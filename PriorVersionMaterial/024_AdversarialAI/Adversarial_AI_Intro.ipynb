    "# Getting Started with Adversarial AI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will setup Microsoft PyRIT to solve the [Gandalf](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/) challenges from Lakera AI.  As an AI Red Teamer, you could manually try to prompt engineer your way to success, and you will often need to do this, but we can also use PyRIT to use an LLM to help us speed up and automate testing an another LLM.  AI vs AI like heavy weight boxing superbout in the LLM division!\n",
    "\n",
    "PyRIT consists of different functions (modules) that perform key tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Targets** are endpoints for where to send prompts. For example, a target could be a GPT-4 or Llama endpoint. Targets are typically used with other components listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **orchestrator's** main job is to change prompts to a given format, apply any converters, and then send them off to prompt targets (sometimes using various strategies). Within an orchestrator, prompt targets are (mostly) swappable, meaning you can use the same logic with different target endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **scorer's** main job is to score a prompt. Often, these use LLMs, in which case, a given scorer can often use different configured targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **converter** transforms a prompt. Often, these use LLMs, in which case, a given converter can use different configured targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gandalf Target\n",
    "\n",
    "Gandalf is similar to a real-world application you might evaluate as an AI Red Teamer. The code and instructions below were adapted from  [Microsoft's custom prompt target example](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT/blob/main/doc/code/targets/2_custom_targets.ipynb) and can be used to adapt to other targets you may encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The premise of the challenge is to make Gandalf reveal the secret password for each level. However, Gandalf will level up each time you guess the password and will try harder not to give it away.Each level gets progressively more difficult. Before continuing, it may be beneficial to manually try the Gandalf challenges to get a feel for how they are solved.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook will uses the [RedTeamingOrchestrator](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT/blob/main/doc/code/orchestrators/2_red_teaming_orchestrator.ipynb) as a strategy to solve these challenges. We will use `OpenAI` target as an \"AI Red Team Bot\" and we suggest the `gpt-4o-mini` model (however you can change to another OpenAI model if you desire). This is our attacker infrastructure, and is used to help the attacker generate prompts to bypass Gandalf protections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1.** AI Red Team Orchestrator sends a message to Gandalf. <br>\n",
    "**Step 2.** Gandalf sends a message back. <br>\n",
    "**Step 3.** The reply is passed to PyRIT's scoring engine to determine if the password was revealed. <br>\n",
    "**Step 4.** The scoring engine sends the potential password from the response to Gandalf. <br>\n",
    "**Step 5.** Gandalf responds with success or failure. <br>\n",
    "**Step 6.** If the password was leaked in the response, the conversation is completed. Otherwise, the Red Team Orchestrator continues from Step 1 with the knowledge of the previous iteration. <br>\n",
