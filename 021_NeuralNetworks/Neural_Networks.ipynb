    "Neural networks are a subset of machine learning algorithms inspired by the human brain's structure and function. They consist of layers of interconnected \"neurons\" that transform the input data through weighted connections to produce an output. Neural networks are particularly powerful for complex tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks consist of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. These layers consist of \"neurons\" where each neuron processes input data by applying a weight and an activation function (like sigmoid or ReLU) to produce an output. The training (or learning) process adjusts the weights of the connections between neurons using algorithms like backpropagation and optimization techniques like gradient descent. Neural networks, particularly deep neural networks (deep learning), can model highly complex relationships between inputs and outputs by learning hierarchical feature representations in the hidden layers. Deep learning neural networks typically contain three or more hidden layers.\n",

    "**Gap Between Training and Validation Accuracy:** A large gap where training accuracy is high but validation accuracy is low indicates overfitting. Efforts like regularization, data augmentation, or a more complex model might help in closing this gap.\n",

    "<u>Crossing or Diverging Curves</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crossing Curves:** If validation loss and accuracy cross significantly (e.g., validation accuracy temporarily surpasses training accuracy), it may indicate randomness in validation performance due to small dataset size or other inconsistencies.\n",

    "With Regularization (e.g., Dropout, L2): Training loss may show more fluctuation or be consistently higher compared to models without regularization. This is normal, as regularization prevents the model from memorizing training data too closely, helping validation loss stay low."
