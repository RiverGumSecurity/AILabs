    "# Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a continuous dependent variable. In other words, it is a predictive modeling technique used to understand the relationship between two variables, where one variable's value is predicted based on the real-time input of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does so by fitting a line (or hyperplane in multiple dimensions) that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values. It is useful to predict future values for similar datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of linear regression is to find coefficients for the model that minimize the MSE, ensuring the model predicts as closely as possible to observed data. By focusing on MSE, linear regression emphasizes both accuracy and sensitivity to outliers in predictions, making it a widely used method for forecasting and data analysis tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "The California Housing Sataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, commonly used for regression tasks. It contains data on housing in California from the 1990 U.S. Census. The dataset's goal is to predict the median house value of districts based on various features, providing a real-world scenario for regression modeling. It is included with scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of 20,640 observations (districts) and 8 features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Median Income**: Median income of households in the district, scaled to a roughly normalized range (e.g., 2–15).\n",
    "2. **House Age**: Median age of houses in the district.\n",
    "3. **Average Rooms**: Average number of rooms per household.\n",
    "4. **Average Bedrooms**: Average number of bedrooms per household.\n",
    "5. **Population**: Total population of the district.\n",
    "6. **Households**: Total number of households in the district.\n",
    "7. **Latitude**: Geographical coordinate (north-south location of the district).\n",
    "8. **Longitude**: Geographical coordinate (east-west location of the district).\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable is **Median House Value**, which is capped at $500,000 in the dataset, creating a slight limitation due to this ceiling effect. The dataset is useful for exploring relationships between socio-economic and geographical factors and housing prices, and it is often used as a benchmark for regression algorithms in machine learning tasks."

    "\n",
    "Interpreting **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**\n",
    "\n",
    "The central metric for evaluating this error is the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, which calculates the average of the squared differences between predicted values $(\\hat{y})$ and true values $(y)$. Squaring these differences ensures that errors are penalized proportionally to their magnitude, emphasizing large deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** quantifies the average squared difference between predicted values (\\(\\hat{y}\\)) and actual values (\\(y\\)) in a regression model. Here's how to interpret it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scale and Units**:\n",
    "   - MSE is measured in the square of the units of the target variable. For example, if the target is housing prices in dollars, the MSE is in squared dollars.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Lower MSE is Better**:\n",
    "   - A smaller MSE indicates that the predictions are closer to the actual values, meaning the model performs better.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Sensitive to Outliers**:\n",
    "   - MSE heavily penalizes large errors because the differences are squared. A few large deviations can significantly increase the MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Absolute Meaning**:\n",
    "   - While MSE is useful for comparing models, its absolute value doesn’t convey how “good” a model is without context. For example, comparing the MSE to the variance of the data can help gauge the model's effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting **\\(R^2\\) (R-squared)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **R-squared** value, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. Its interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range**:\n",
    "   - \\(R^2\\) ranges from 0 to 1:\n",
    "     - \\(R^2 = 0\\): The model explains none of the variance in the target variable (no predictive power).\n",
    "     - \\(R^2 = 1\\): The model explains all of the variance in the target variable (perfect predictive power).\n",
    "   - In rare cases, \\(R^2\\) can be negative if the model performs worse than simply predicting the mean value of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Higher \\(R^2\\) is Better**:\n",
    "   - Higher \\(R^2\\) values indicate that the model accounts for more of the variability in the target variable. However, a high \\(R^2\\) doesn’t always mean the model is good—it might be overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complementary to MSE**:\n",
    "   - While MSE gives an absolute error metric, \\(R^2\\) gives a relative measure of how well the model captures variability compared to a baseline (the mean).\n",
    "\n",
    "If \\(R^2 = 0.85\\), it means the model explains 85% of the variance in housing prices, which is usually a sign of a strong model, assuming the data isn’t overfit or has multicollinearity issues."
